Done:
Simulate an 8-bit ripple carry adder.
  Start by creating a class called "transistor", and a class called "not-gate", that do what those respective components would do in real life.
  Create logic gates (and, or, x-or) using the transistor and not-gate objects.
  Create half-adder, and full-adder classes from the logic gate objects.
  Create an 8-bit ripple carry adder class from the half-, and full-adder objects.
  
To be done:
  Create an Arithmic Logic Unit (ALU).
  Create memory (RAM)
  Continue up the ladder until something that resembles an 8-bit computer emerges.
